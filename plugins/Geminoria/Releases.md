## **_Agentic Gemini‑powered search for [Limnoria](https://github.com/progval/Limnoria) — Beta Release_**

This beta introduces a major architectural upgrade to Geminoria, shifting from environment‑based configuration to a fully **Limnoria‑native**, **config‑driven**, **agentic design**. It is feature‑complete for the 1.1 series and ready for wider testing.

# ✨ What’s new

## Config‑driven Gemini integration

- Gemini API key now stored in Limnoria config: supybot.plugins.Geminoria.apiKey
- Model selection also moved to config: supybot.plugins.Geminoria.model
- Hot‑reload behaviour: client automatically refreshes when the key changes.

# Improved agentic loop

- More robust round‑based tool execution.
- Cleaner extraction of function calls and text responses.
- Final synthesis step added when tool‑call limit is reached.
- Graceful fallback to tool results if Gemini returns no text.

# Enhanced config search

- New config walker returns (full_path, is_leaf) pairs.
- Leaf keys are prioritised for relevance.
- Output formatted as a clean, readable list for IRC.
- Automatic highlighting of exact config keys in responses.

# Better logging

- Round‑by‑round agentic debugging.
- Tool call tracing with summarised output.
- Capability‑denial logging.
- Client refresh logging.
- Compact text summariser for log readability.

# Cleaner SDK integration

- Added _schema(),_tool(), and _gen_config() helpers to avoid Pylance issues with generated models.
- System instruction rewritten for clarity and IRC‑friendly output.

# 🛠️ Fixes & refinements

- More predictable whitespace and markdown cleaning.
- URL and message buffers remain lightweight and bounded.
- Capability checks now log denials for easier debugging.
- Safer handling of missing candidates or malformed responses.
- Improved fallback behaviour when Gemini returns empty content.

# ⚠️ Beta notes

- This is a pre‑release intended for real‑world testing.
- Behaviour may change slightly before the final 1.1.0 release.
- Please report any issues with tool‑calling behaviour, config detection, or Gemini responses.
